## What is this container for?
This container runs SSH server and is configured to run Midnight Commander directly after login.  
So essentially this container is a remote accessible file manager.  

## Why use this container?
**Simply put, this container has been written with simplicity and security in mind.**

Many community containers run unnecessarily with root privileges by default and don't provide help for dropping unneeded CAPabilities either.
On top of that, overly complex shell scripts, monolithic designs and unofficial base images make it harder to verify the source among other issues.

To remedy the situation, these images have been written with security and simplicity in mind.

|Requirement                   |Status|Details|
|------------------------------|:----:|-------|
|Don't run container as root   |❌    | OpenSSH 7.5 makes privilege separation mandatory which requires root, but those privileges are dropped. TODO: Maybe change to some other SSH-server? |
|Official base image           |✅    | |
|Drop extra CAPabilities       |✅    | See ```docker-compose.yml``` |
|No default passwords          |✅    | No static default passwords. That would make the container insecure by default.|
|Support secrets-files         |✅    | Support providing e.g. passwords via files instead of environment variables.|
|Handle signals properly       |✅    | |
|Simple Dockerfile             |✅    | No overextending the container's responsibilities. And keep everything in the Dockerfile if reasonable. |
|Versioned tags                |✅    | Offer versioned tags for stability.|

## Running this container
See the example ```docker-compose.yml``` in the source repository.  
The username for connecting the container is ```mc```.

### Supported tags
See the ```Tags``` tab on Docker Hub for specifics. Basically you have:
- The default ```latest``` tag that always has the latest changes.
- Minor versioned tags (follow Semantic Versioning), e.g. ```1.1``` which would follow branch ```1.1.x``` on GitHub.

### Configuration
See ```Dockerfile``` and ```docker-compose.yml``` (<https://github.com/kalaksi/docker-midnight-commander>) for usable environment variables. Variables that are left empty will use default values.  
  
To modify sshd configuration, modify the ```sshd_config``` file located in the ```midnight-commander```-volume.  
To modify Midnight Commander configuration, you can bind-mount over the configuration files under ```/home/mc/.config/mc```.
